Running the script:
To run the script you will need to download AutoHotkey, at autohotkey.com
Then simply open the script (.ahk file) to run it. If you don't want to use it immediately, 
then press Alt+P, which suspends the hotkeys until you toggle it on again (Alt+P again).

Control:
Alt+P: Pause or unpause hotkeys (incase you want to use the hotkeys normally)

Alt+C: Set the numbers to what you have copied, separated by
"&".  For example, if you copy "1000&4" it will start with 1000,4 and count up.
If you wanted to instead make all countries, then copy "country,population&1", do Alt+C, 
then keep right clicking.

Alt+S: Set the first number in the combination to 1000 and the second to 1


Hotkeys:
RightClick: Get 1 number/element
[: add 1
]: add -1
;: do *2
': do *[whatever you've copied]
\: add whatever you've copied
